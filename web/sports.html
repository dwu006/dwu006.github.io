	<h3>Ever since I was young I loved playing sports, whether it was soccer, 
		swimming, running, capture the flag, badminton, etc, I loved every 
		aspect of it. I loved the thrill and competitiveness of these sports 
		and greatly enjoyed meeting new friends that also loved playing sports.
	I hope I would be able to keep playing sports in college.</h3>
