	<center><p>I have been playing badminton since I was 9 years old. 
		It first started when we were in Taiwan visiting family, relatives, 
		and friends. Some of my parents friends played badminton and this 
		inspired my mom to sign up badminton classes for me back home. I first 
	played and started learning badminton at EastBay Badminton Association. I started playing as a hobby but then I started playing competition.
	Due to lack of players and competition, I moved to United Badminton Club, which was a hour away. A lot of stuff happened during qurantined but in short UBC closed down 
	everyone together to another club, Synergy, where I currently still train. There I started to improve a lot training with more and better players, 
and was able to place Top 16 in 2021 US Junior Nationals and Top 8 in 2022 Junior International Trials. Throughout my badminton career
I have been blessed with coaches that play, train, and coach me. I would have never gotten to this point without them. Here are their names:
Jing Yu Hong (Coach Kate), Halim Haryanto Ho (Coach Halim), Norman Lam (Coach Norman), 
Chu Ming Hua (Coach Hua), Xiaomu Liu (Coach Liu), Ankit Chhikara (Coach Ankit), Howard Bach (Coach Howard), Balram Thapa (Coach Balram), Ratna Jit Tamang (Coach Ratna),
Naoko Fukman (Coach Naoko), Yuta Kikuchi (Coach Yuta), Yoo Yeon Seong (Coach Yoo), Shota Haraguchi (Coach Shota), Kohei Matsumoto (Coach Kohei), Shlok Ramchandran (Coach Shlok).</p>
