	<center><p>I have been playing badminton since I was 9 years old. 
		It first started when we were in Taiwan visiting family, relatives, 
		and friends. Some of my parents friends played badminton and this 
		inspired my mom to sign up badminton classes for me back home. I first 
	played and started learning badminton at EastBay Badminton Association in 
	EmeryVille, California. I started playing as a hobby but then I started playing competition.
	There wasn't a lot of people left and there wasn't a lot of competition for me at EBA, so I
	 moved to United Badminton Club in Fremont, California. This club was 
around a hour drive away from our home, but my parents were willing to make that sacrifice 
for us to train. The training there was harder and there was more players to practice with.
Even though this was a tiring schedule with school, I got used to it. I started small, eventually being able to place 
top 5 in small local and regional tournaments, which was nice but I wanted to go further. Soon Covid hit
and we weren't able to train for a long time. I had to self train at home using weights and a treadmill. 
We also sometimes hosted zoom sessions for group phyiscal sessions. A lot of stuff happened but in short UBC closed down and 
everyone went kind of moved together to another club, Synergy, where I currently still train. There I started to improve a lot training with more and better players, 
and was able to place Top 16 in 2021 US Junior Nationals and Top 8 in 2022 Junior International Trials. Throughout my badminton career
I have been blessed with coaches that play, train, and coach me. I would have never gotten to this point without them.
