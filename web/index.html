		  <center><p>Hello there! My name is Daniel Wu. I am 17 years old and currently attending Miramonte High School as a senior. My family has my mom, dad, younger sister, and myself. 
			My younger sister, Jessica is also attending Miramonte as a sophmore. I lived the first 11 years of my life in Berkeley, California. I attended Kensington Hilltop Elementary 
			School for elementary up to 5th grade before moving. For middle school, I attended Orinda Intermediate School in Orinda. Currently, I attend Miramonte High School and I am 
		set to graduate in May 2024. Going into high school and probably well before that, I have already decided that I was going to major in either Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or Electrical Engineering.  </p></center>
