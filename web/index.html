		  <center><p>Hello there! My name is Daniel Wu. I am 17 years old and currently attending Miramonte High School as a senior. There is 4 people in my family: mom, dad, younger sister, and myself. 
			My younger sister named Jessica is also attending Miramonte as a sophmore. I lived my first 11 years in Berkely, California specifically in El Cerrito. I attended Kensington Hilltop Elementary School for elementary up to 5th grade 
			before moving to Moraga. Although it was heartbreaking to leave my friends which I known since kindergarten, I was looking forward to a new environment and 
			meeting new friends. For middle school, I attended Orinda Intermediate School in Orinda. Next, I attended Miramonte High School and I am 
		set to graduate in May 2024. Going into high school and probably well before that, I have already decided that I was going to major in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or Electrical Engineering.  </p></center>
