				<h2>2019 Season</h2>
				<p>This was my first year of Cross Country during middle school (8th grade). 
					I joined since many of my friends were doing it and I thought it would be 
					fun to run with them and a way for me to train for badminton too. Although 
					I wasn't able to get on varsity because I didn't go to enough meets, I still 
					was able to run for junior varsity and placed 4th at the championship! We also 
					ended winning Junior Varsity Cross Country Championship for our school!
