	<h4>Taking online courses is a great way for me to learn these skills because of my busy schedule with badminton. 
		Through theses courses I have quickly learned a lot of new stuff that I can use when I program my own applications, such as this website.

		<h5><u>Inspirit AI</u></h5>
		<div class="txt">
			One word to describe Inspirit AI is fun. I had such a great time learning from my amazing instructors Andrew (Harvard) and Matthew (MIT)
			and collaborating with others especially my group (Leo, Ben, Ahdil). AI is so amazing and has so many capabilities and this camp has 
			made me more interested in AI in wanting to learn, use, build AI. This program is really good and I recommend it to anyone interested in AI.
			Below is my group's presentation as well as results from the object detection model we built. I also included a short paper I wrote to summarize what I learned 
			and our approach to object detecting. Enjoy!
